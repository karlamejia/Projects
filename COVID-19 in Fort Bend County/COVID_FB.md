The Fort Bend County Community Impact Dashboard reports the daily total
of positive COVID-19 cases by reported date as well as the daily total
of tests conducted by the county. The daily percent of positive cases is
not provided even though it is more informative than daily case totals
since they don’t take into account how many tests were conducted.

It is unclear from the dashboard whether the reported positive cases
include cases that were determined through tests not conducted by the
county (e.g. tests conducted at a hospital or clinic). It is also
unclear when the tests for the positive cases were conducted since the
dashboard only displays the reported case date. That is why the data
were aggregated at the weekly level and the percent of positive cases
derived from it considered an estimate.
