# Projects

## 1. Dengue Forecasting
For this project, I used Google Trends to forecast dengue in Mexico from 2004 to 2011.

## 2. Interactive Map of Africa 
I used plotly in R to create an interactive map of Africa of the official languages spoken in Africa. The map also displays summary information about the estimated population and internet penetration rates of each country.
