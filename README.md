# Projects

## 1. Dengue Forecasting
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people in tropical and subtropical countries around the world. I used [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) to forecast dengue in Mexico from 2007 to 2011.

## 2. Interactive Map of Africa 
I used [plotly](https://plot.ly/) with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to create an interactive map of the official languages spoken in Africa. The map also displays summary information about the estimated population and internet penetration rate of each country. 

## 3. Scrape Google Trends Website
I used the [pytrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends) package by [GeneralMills](https://github.com/GeneralMills) to write [Python](https://www.python.org/) code to scrape the [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) website.
